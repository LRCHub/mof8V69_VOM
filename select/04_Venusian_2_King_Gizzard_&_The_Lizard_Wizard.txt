In the lap of the Gods
The last one did explode
In a blaze all fiery
I sit in the cockpit
It may be a sinking ship
But fortune favors bravery
Road trip with me
Vitamin V
In focus now
Venusian 2 (venusian 2)
Fingers getting warm
And eyes are turning gold
Evil twin is coming in
Weathering the storm
I put the birdie down
For the sin, I have a grin
Road trip with me
Vitamin V
I see the ground
Venusian 2 (venusian 2)
